      Between FHIR, APIs, HL7, X12, TEFCA, USCDI, HIPAA, and more, there's a
      veritable alphabet soup within HIT. Successfully navigating the healthcare
      technology jungle requires a strong grasp of common interoperability
      methods and their pros and cons, the EHR landscape and the obstacles it
      presents, and the regulatory environment that is generating rapid change
      within the industry.


      Lean on us to give your team a strong foundation of knowledge. Once they
      understand integrations well, they will design, build, and implement
      integrations well.

      Integrations are only useful if they enhance, not detract from, the user's
      workflow.


      To determine if your workflows are suitable for integrations, get in touch
      with us. We analyze the user experience from start to finish and recommend
      workflow enhancements or product tweaks to optimize the value of
      integrations. We can also advise your product and engineering teams to
      ensure their tech stack is up to the challenge, and we can recommend
      integration platforms and full-service integrators to lighten the
      development and maintenance burden for you.
