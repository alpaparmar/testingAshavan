          Our customer was on a mission to transform their business model and
          embrace technology. They had developed a minimum viable product that
          integrated with Epic's APIs, and they needed our help in implementing
          it. Ashavan stepped in and led implementations nationwide, resulting
          in nearly three dozen live customers within the year. We also served
          as a liaison between end users and engineers and played an active role
          in identifying, triaging, and designing fixes and enhancements to the
          product.


          By Q4, the app was one of the most downloaded offerings on the App
          Market (fka the App Orchard), and the customer had built a similarly
          robust integration with Cerner. Today, health systems live with the
          integration see more than 80% of previously manual transactions now
          automated, reducing variability and freeing up staff for more complex
          tasks.

          Our customer sought to make FHIR API support a native part of their
          platform. They tapped Ashavan to advise on the best ways to structure
          their data model and architect their integration solutions. They
          leaned on us as well to understand the ins and outs of FHIR, the
          varying levels of FHIR coverage across the major EHRs, and the edge
          cases to account for in their design and development. With our help,
          they released a new integrated module that multiple customers are
          actively enabling.

          Stuck, frustrated, and running out of time. That was the position this
          healthcare organization was in as they tried to integrate Epic with
          their CRM software using Jitterbit. Their first integration vendor
          fell through, and the replacement vendor had no Epic expertise. Enter
          Ashavan to get the project back on track.


          We helped the customer understand the full picture of integrations and
          what was possible, and based on their feedback, we directed the
          integration vendor on data field mapping and solution architecture.
          When unique challenges arose, we also stepped in and built a
          half-dozen custom integrations using Epic's private REST APIs. The
          go-live was on-time and successful, and for 12 months post-go-live,
          Ashavan took on full support for maintaining and enhancing all API,
          HL7, and delimited file integrations within Jitterbit.

          Ease of use is one of the most important contributors to the value of
          software. After seeing some success with a standalone product, this
          technology company, which uses artificial intelligence to match
          patients to clinical trials, knew a change was needed to maximize its
          product’s potential. The organization wanted to make its app into an
          Epic SMART on FHIR app that could be launched during a patient exam.


          Initially, Product and Engineering leadership brought us in to guide
          them on integration strategy and development, including how to
          facilitate the SMART on FHIR launch in the most efficient manner and
          how to obtain all the needed details for patient and provider matching
          within the AI platform. After that, we created comprehensive
          documentation for the Client Success team to direct Epic customers on
          how to implement the newly integrated app. The company expects this
          version of their product to have significant adoption due to its
          availability within the clinician’s workflow.

          Expanding into a new clinical specialty can be fraught with
          challenges. Our customer, recently valued at over $1 billion, was
          knowledgeable of the perioperative space but was looking to grow the
          business and take on their first inpatient acute care contract. They
          sought answers to questions such as:


          *   Which integration options are available to us, and how do we gain
          access to them?


          *   How much would each option cost and how long would it take to
          implement?


          *   How much effort would the health system client need to put in?


          *   How well does each integration method align to our existing data
          model and data frequency requirements?


          We developed a comprehensive white paper laying out all of the
          options, the pros and cons of each approach, and our formal
          recommendation. The customer commented that the "output of work was
          detailed" and the document "helps us really explain the why/why not
          for each option with clients." We have since shifted into serving as
          ongoing advisors who bring credibility and expertise to sales calls
          and implementations.

          Sometimes you just need a second set of eyes. This small but growing
          firm had a fairly simple need. As part of their expansion into
          healthcare, they invested in new products and policies to keep
          sensitive data and protected health information safe and secure. Our
          customer asked us to review the policies and training materials they
          created to ensure they were following industry best practices,
          respecting HIPAA requirements, and protecting themselves and their
          customers. We revised the documentation's language to make it more
          clear and prescriptive, and we identified gaps to fill in their
          policies and procedures in order to minimize the risk of a data
          breach.
