      ### We're dedicated to helping people live their best lives


      *Ashavan* is an ancient Avestan word that roughly translates to "a
      righteous or just person." While there is no formula for a perfect human
      being, we want people all over the world to be healthier, wealthier,
      better educated, and more successful, and we strive to provide products
      and services to help them get there.


      ### Our mission is to make the best choice the easiest one


      Ashavan is fundamentally a company focused on choices. When a person or
      business makes better choices, they will achieve better results. We help
      our customers by clarifying the choices they must make, guiding them
      towards the optimal one for their circumstances, and making it as easy as
      possible to execute on that choice.

      ### We specialize in interoperability


      Today, Ashavan concentrates on connecting disparate software systems and
      exchanging data between them. Technology has the power to get software
      applications talking to one another, but it often isn't easy or obvious
      how to do so. We aim to change that.


      ### We live by our core qualities and core actions


      We go beyond core values, because we don't think they are sufficient.
      Instead, our core qualities and core actions guide us every day. Much like
      adjectives and verbs in a sentence, our core qualities describe our work
      and our core actions inform how we work.
